# spark-nlp-Pyspark

**Create a Spark ML Pipeline using the following annotators (Use English pretrained models):**

 #### a.	DocumentAssembler
  
 #### b.	Tokenizer
  
 #### c.	WordEmbeddingsModel (Word Embeddings, Glove)
  
 #### d.	PerceptronModel (Part of Speech)
  
####  e.	NerCrfModel (Named Entity Recognition)
  
  

Print the transformed DataFrame showing only the POS column and the NER column. BONUS: Show only the result attribute of these Annotations


Collect the result attribute of NER and POS, find a way to explain any relationship (if exists) between found entities and their part of speech attributes.
